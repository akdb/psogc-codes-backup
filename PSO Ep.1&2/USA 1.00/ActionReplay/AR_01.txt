How to use these codes:

1. Save your game with the 'Make Game Save Copyable' code turned on and your source memory card
   in port A:

   To save your System file, go into the options menu from start screen and go back.
   To save your Character and Guildcard file, go ingame and quit.

2. Copy your System, Character and Guildcard file from your source memory card to your destination
   memory card (via GameCube system menu).

3. Start PSO with your destination memory card in port A and save your System file with the 'Make
   Game Save Valid' code turned on. Your game save is valid now and works fine without AR codes.

4. Please note that you cannot mix different game saves, because all Character and Guildcard files
   are encrypted with a unique timestamp (stored in the System file).
